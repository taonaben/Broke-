# Broke?

My new Flutter project.

## Description 

# Broke?
Broke? is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to help users make better financial decisions. This app guides users through a series of questions to evaluate the necessity and impact of potential financial actions, such as buying something, going on a date, or borrowing money.

# Features
Buying Something: Asks about the item, its cost, and the user's available funds. Guides the user through a series of questions to determine if the purchase is necessary and feasible.
Going on a Date: Evaluates if the date is worth the expenditure based on how long the user has known the person and the vibes of the relationship.
Borrowing Money: Assesses the necessity of borrowing money and the user's ability to repay it. Guides the user through questions to ensure the decision is well thought out.
